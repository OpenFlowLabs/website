During these past few months quite a few things have changed in Switzerland. A Pandemic is passing through the Country, 
and a lot of places needed to adapt to that new reality. While a lot of things are happening, we would like to focus on 
what is happening in the Offices and how existing and new digitalisation techniques can be used to work effectively
within these new constraints.

# The impact of the Shutdown
Before the shutdown, a lot of office based companies where ran on the principle, that you have to work in the same office to be a team.
Homeoffice was a frequently talked about bonus given on special occasions or used to advertise for workplaces but 
mostly limited to higher positions in the company. Homeoffice was considered a luxury. But with the shutdown that had to change.
while it was still considered a luxury, it was seen as the lesser evil compared to ceasing operations completely. While the
beginning was a bit shaky for some, knowledge on how to address these issues was circulated fast, and existing Technology that
had been put into the storage closet, because surely nobody would want to ever use it got put into action again. 
The myth of physical presence got exposed for what it was, a myth. You need presence and communication to act collaboratively
, but that does not need to by physical. In fact a virtual collaboration offers many benefits over the physical one. Interruptions
are reduced, as it is simply not possible to walk to someones desk and ask for something to get done next week. Communication can
easily be switched, to be asynchronous by the receiver and thus focus can be maintained.

# Creating a successful digital workplace
While focus is a good part of a functioning workplace there is also other parts, that a functioning workplace needs. 
These parts are:
 - Social connection between collaborating parties
 - A place to manage a list of tasks
 - Storage for knowledge that is visible by everybody in the organisation
 - Space for Humor

This realisation is not new. It is used by many companies, some even going so far as to not have any offices at all like GitLab.
While OpenFlowLabs is a new company we are in the situation that we are spread over two continents. To keep in contact with
each other we use a couple of existing tools, that have emerged over the past few years. Maintaining social connection is one
of the simplest things to start doing, as the technology for that has been available for decades. e-Mail and Chat software
allow communicating easily and asynchronously with each other. While that works for most things, sometimes there is a need to
do a work session together. For this [Zoom](https://zoom.us) and other Videoconferencing tools like [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) 
work wonders. While they need a stable internet connection they make it possible to interact on Online documents while talking
normally with each other as if we are in the same office together. For a new startups like us, these work sessions are 
organised quite naturally and chaotically. We leave space for social connection, jokes, and grabbing coffee/tea. Zoom has features 
including digital backgrounds and screenshots which can be used to creatively play during meetings and keep a sense of Humor. 
While it might be of interest to have dedicated meetings for the social part of work it is still an important part of work.
