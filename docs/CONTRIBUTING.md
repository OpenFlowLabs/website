## Getting started
There are currently two main branches: `master` with the current website and
`next` with a fresh Next.js codebase.

### Branch: `next`
In case you prefer working via nvm, you can use the
script `init-repo-by-nvm.sh` to install yarn via npm, using
the version specified in `.nvmrc`.
