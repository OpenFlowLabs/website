# Our changes and new Partners
In the last few months OpenFlowLabs has seen from some drastic changes to its structure. 
We are now a registered company and have new friends and partners working with us. First of is the split of the 
business related design and strategy into its own brand and channels under the Umbrella of [Fruitsteps](https://www.fruitsteps.com).
If you are looking to change your business or adapt yourself to these trying times give them a call. Do you have
a corporate programm for responsibility and don't know what to do? Give our Partners at [Blocco](https://www.blocolab.com/english) a call.
And [OpenFlowLabs](https://www.openflowlabs.com) itself? We take care of the technology side of things. We make things simply work. 
From planning to implementation and everything surrounding the technology you want. Let us know if you are interested.

# Sneak peek
So what is coming down the pipeline? We and our Partners are working, and have been doing so quite some time already, on 
a couple of products. Taking responsibility has been a topic of many talks between Us and our partners. While doing so within
our domains of expertise is quite simple, it is hard to do so as a society. We and our partners have looked at this topic for the
last 4 years now, and we think it is doable. Todo so, we need to enable capital to flow to the right places and enable people 
to give feedback. And a lot of people are already doing that, but they are lacking visibility. We are building something to change that.
Showing truthfully what impact is happening in the world should be even simpler than posting to social media, and at least equally engaging.

This is not everything we are building. Unfortunately many things are not quite ready to show off yet, but we are working on it.
Stay tuned for more in depth articles in the future on this, Digitalization and other topics dear to us.
